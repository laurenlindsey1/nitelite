NiteLite project
==============================
Presentation:
   good job on the presentation!  the slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  this is a very useful project!  your presentation
   skills were very professional and having the statistics to back up your
   rationale for the idea was a great addition.  having specific examples of
   users and situations that would benefit from your idea was also a wonderful
   idea.

   also, I like the way you broke out the technologies showing what each one
   would be used for ~~ that's something not many groups do at the proposal
   stage of this course, but IS something you'll need when you get into the
   industry!

Proposal Document:
   nice work here, as well.  The description is at high enough level to give
   the reader the overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader know
   what some of the thoughts behind the application are as well as the goals.

   the justification section is well done as well, specifying the MVP focus
   for the initial project goal as well as similar products and why yours is
   different.  the focus on all team members learning new concepts and tech
   from each other is outstanding to highlight!

Great job on this presentation and proposal!
