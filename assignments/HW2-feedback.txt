On Problem 3, Waterfall has six phases.  Yes, there are several of them that
are the same as Agile, but specifically Waterfall has requirements, design,
coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.  Agile only uses the first 4.

Very perceptive answer on problem 5 about assumptions!  Also, great point in
problem 6 about "feature fatigue".

Another great point about managing the customer's expectations by being up
front and open with communication.  Excellent example for problem 9.

Great work as usual!
