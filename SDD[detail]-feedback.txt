Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
Wow, this is AWESOME!  You have nailed it again, with your usual aplomb....

The detail presented is good for an architectural view of the project.  Feel
free to include some diagrams when you put in the detailed section.

OMG, that is the best user manual I've seen since 2005!!

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Good work here, as well.  The detail in section 7 is good as descriptions.  I
was hoping to see a little more detail in terms of how to BUILD the parts you
describe here.  That's the point of detailed design.  However, this close to
the end of the semester, I don't expect you to go back and re-vamp this part
since you have already built so much of it.  Might be something to consider
doing for your second semester effort, in which case you could make the
document match what you've actually built.  "Descriptive" document rather
than "prescriptive" document......

All told, great job!

Evaluation score:

      15% out of 15% for this deliverable:   A-plus
         Note that the "CDR presentation is folded into "ABCDR"
            so the 15% reflects 10% for detail and 5% for CDR
