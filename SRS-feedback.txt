=====================================================================================
WOW!  A stellar job on this deliverable!  I see you have already done the SDP
part as well, even though only the schedule part was actually due.  You have
done EXCELLENT work on this submission!

In the functional requirements section, usually what you'll see is the same
breakdown as in section 5.2 so that the functional requirements match exactly
with the breakdown.  This means the "dot" numbers are duplicated as well.  So
for example, there should be a section "5.3.1 React Front End Requirements"
with the requirements for that numbered "5.3.1.1" through "5.3.1.x"  Then
there would be a "5.3.2 Database Requirements", and so on.

I see opportunities to provide more details in some areas; for example, 5.3.5
specifies user-specified safe spots are stored "upon account creation", but
how does the application know what to store if the account has only just been
created?  In 5.3.8 you actually have THREE requirements, since you are pulling
data from three different API's.  In 5.3.9, you specify the user's "relevant
streets and walking paths" but what does 'relevant' mean, and how is that
relevance determined?

You've done a lot of work on this, and I can tell that significant amounts of
thought, effort, and discussion went into it!  It's a VERY nice job!  Think
about adding some further information to it during the course of the semester
with a focus on these feedback suggestions, and submit a second version by
the end of the semester for full credit on this document!
